# python-api-challenge-Module 6 Challenge
This challenge analyzes weather data to find the most suitable location for a vacation. We find the relationship between the latitude, temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and windspeed.
Then we figure out which locations have our desired weather and the closest hotel to the marked location. The data is displayed through a map after running the cells on Jupyter Notebook.
